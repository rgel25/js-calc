## Welcome! üëã
calc is a basic web application that features a barebone calculator powered by JavaScript. Please note that the highlight of this project is not the functionality of the calculator but how the application was coded.

## The challenge

The main challenge here is to create a JS calculator app using event delegation and ES6 class concepts.

## My solution

- I created a calc class that basically houses all the its behaivor so that the global space is not polluted.
- I also delegated the events so that only one element has an eventlistner, focusing on maximum efficiency.

## Technologies used

- HTML - Used to create the index.html file
- CSS - Used to design the webpage
- JavaScript - Logic implementation
- VSCode - IDE I used to create the web app
- Git - For version control
- Netflify - Used to host this web app
